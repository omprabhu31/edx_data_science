## Notes - Data Science Professional Certificate
### Offered by HarvardX on edX - [Link](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science)

Hi, this is where I'll be uploading my notes from all the nine courses part of the Data Science Professional Certificate offered by HarvardX on edX. I'll be adding notes from each course as soon as I complete it. These are mainly meant for my own reference if needed later, but I've tried my best to maintain them in a way that other users should be able to easily understand stuff.

These are not traditional notes in the sense that they are not PDF, Word or Markdown files. The file format is .R, so although you could technically get through the material using the repository page or something like Notepad, I'd highly recommend you to install R locally from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) as well as a suitable IDE such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 

Each file contains relevant code which I've tried to comment as properly as possible. In case you need additional context, you can also refer to relevant sections in the PDF copy of the course textbook (also in this repository). For obvious reasons, I have not uploaded assessment solutions. If you find any errors or wish to suggest some modifications, please feel free to do so using the [contact page](https://omprabhu31.github.io/contact/) on [my website](https://omprabhu31.github.io/).

That's it for now, have fun :)
